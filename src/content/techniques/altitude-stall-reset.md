## What changes at altitude
Lower humidity can shorten the stall but increase surface drying. If bark is set early, the stall can disappear, risking a dry flat.

## Reset strategy
- Wrap 10–15°F earlier.
- Lower pit temp by 10°F after wrapping.
- Extend the rest to re-balance moisture.

## When to apply
Use this approach for brisket and pork shoulder when bark is set but the fat still feels tight.
