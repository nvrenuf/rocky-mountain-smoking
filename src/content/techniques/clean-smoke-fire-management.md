## Why clean smoke matters
Thin air can trick you into running your pit too hot. Clean smoke keeps bark from turning bitter and protects fat render.

## The high-altitude approach
- Use smaller splits so the fire doesn’t spike.
- Pre-heat splits on the firebox to reduce white smoke.
- Keep the exhaust open and manage heat with the intake.

## Stability checklist
1. Lock in a 225–250°F baseline.
2. Add a split before the temperature dips.
3. Watch the smoke color, not just the thermometer.
