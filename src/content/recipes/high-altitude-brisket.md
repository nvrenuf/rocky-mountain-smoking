## Overview
This brisket method is built for altitude: dry air accelerates bark formation and can dry the flat if your pit climbs too fast. We hold the pit steady at 250°F, keep humidity in the cook chamber, and plan for a longer rest to stabilize moisture.

## Prep
- Trim the brisket to a 1/4-inch fat cap.
- Season with a 50/50 salt and coarse pepper blend.
- Let it sweat in the fridge overnight or rest on the counter for 45 minutes.

## Smoke
1. Stabilize the pit at 250°F with clean smoke.
2. Place brisket fat side down if the heat source is below the grate; otherwise fat side up.
3. Spritz every 90 minutes after bark begins to set.
4. Wrap when bark is set and the fat begins to render (usually 165°F internal).

## Finish + Rest
- Pull when the flat probes like warm butter (around 203–206°F).
- Rest wrapped in a dry cooler for at least 2 hours.
- Slice across the grain and serve immediately.

## Altitude adjustment
If your pit dries out, add a larger water pan or reduce airflow slightly to keep the bark from hardening too early.
