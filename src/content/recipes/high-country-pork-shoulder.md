## Overview
This shoulder recipe balances bark and moisture in a dry climate. A foil pan finish keeps juices in the wrap while the rest evens out the heat.

## Prep
- Trim loose fat and remove glands.
- Season with salt, pepper, paprika, and brown sugar.
- Let rest 30 minutes while the pit stabilizes.

## Smoke
1. Hold pit at 245°F with clean smoke.
2. Spritz every 90 minutes once the bark starts to set.
3. Wrap in a foil pan at 160°F with a splash of apple juice.

## Finish + Rest
- Pull at 204–205°F.
- Vent for 10 minutes, then rest for 2 hours.
- Shred and mix in a few spoonfuls of defatted juices.
