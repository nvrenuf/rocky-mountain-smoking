## Overview
Chicken at altitude dries quickly if the pit runs too low. We push heat and add a quick cast-iron finish for bite-through skin.

## Prep
- Dry brine the chicken for 4 hours.
- Pat dry and brush with neutral oil.
- Season with salt, pepper, and a touch of smoked paprika.

## Smoke
1. Stabilize pit at 325°F.
2. Smoke skin-side up for 50 minutes.
3. Finish skin-side down in a hot cast-iron pan for 2 minutes.

## Finish + Rest
- Pull at 165–170°F.
- Rest for 10 minutes.
- Slice and serve immediately.
